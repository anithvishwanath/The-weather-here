# The weather here

Hi! This is a project that is based on The Coding Train's video series on "Working with Data and APIs in JavaScript", which is based on "The weather here" project by Joey K Lee. 

This project uses the OpenWeatherMap and the OpenAQ APIs for the weather and air quality, respectively. Maps are handled via Leaflet.js.

## To-do:
